# CSE251B
# Deep Learning

This repository contains the details of the implementation of different programming assignments for CSE 251B (Deep Learning).

# PA 1 - Collaborators - Sreekrishna and Shweta Singh
1. To run this code, please copy the datasets into the same directory as PA1. Ensure that they are present. 

2. Once, they are available, please run PAQ5-Part_ac_d.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).

3. Similarly, run the file PAQ5Partb.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(b). 

4. Please run logisticRegression.ipynb to generate results for 5(b) where features are extracted through PCA.

5. To generate the results for 6(a) and 6(c), please run PAQ6-Parta_c.ipynb to generate the results for Softmax regression

6. Similarly, run the file PAQ6-partb.ipynb to generate the results for Part 6(b).

# PA 2 - Completely implemented by Sreekrishna
1. To run this code, select whether 3(b) or 3(c) should be run. For question 3(b), just run PA2.ipynb with run_q3b variable set to True.
2. For the other parts in the assignment, run the respective parts of the code 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f).
3. Part (f) has three subparts to it. The first one could be run by 3(f).ipynb and the other could be run using Q3(f).ipynb

# PA 3 - Collaborators - Sreekrishna, Gautham and Akshaya
1. Currently, this assignment is under construction.
