# CSE251B
# Deep Learning

This repository contains the details of the implementation of different programming assignments for CSE 251B (Deep Learning).

# PA 1 - Collaborators - Sreekrishna and Shweta Singh
1. To run this code, please copy the datasets into the same directory as PA1. Ensure that they are present. 

2. Once, they are available, please run PAQ5-Part_ac_d.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).

3. Similarly, run the file PAQ5Partb.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(b). 

4. Please run logisticRegression.ipynb to generate results for 5(b) where features are extracted through PCA.

5. To generate the results for 6(a) and 6(c), please run PAQ6-Parta_c.ipynb to generate the results for Softmax regression

6. Similarly, run the file PAQ6-partb.ipynb to generate the results for Part 6(b).

# PA 2 - Completely implemented by Sreekrishna
1. To run this code, select whether 3(b) or 3(c) should be run. For question 3(b), just run PA2.ipynb with run_q3b variable set to True.
2. For the other parts in the assignment, run the respective parts of the code 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f).
3. Part (f) has three subparts to it. The first one could be run by 3(f).ipynb and the other could be run using Q3(f).ipynb

# PA 3 - Collaborators - Sreekrishna, Gautham, Akshaya, Justin and Tri Truong

1. Each of the collaborator has their own branch -

2. Sreekrishna - main branch, Akshaya - Akshaya_Train, Justin - jh, Tri Truong - tt

3. In this work, the following are the contributions made by each one -

   3.1 Sreekrishna - Development of the baseline model, implementation of FCN, early stopping and hyper-parameter tuning
   
   3.2 Akshaya & Gautham - Involved in the design of the baseline model, implementation of IoU/pixel accuracy, generation of results, early stopping and hyper-parameter tuning.
   
   3.3 Justin - Implementation of UNet model
   
   3.4 Tri - Design and implementation of the Transfer Learning Model.
