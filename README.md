# CSE251B
# Deep Learning

This repository contains the details of the implementation of programming assignments for CSE 251B (Deep Learning).

To run this code, please copy the datasets into the same directory as PA1. Ensure that they are present. 

Once, they are available, please run PAQ5-Part_ac_d.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).

Similarly, run the file PAQ5Partb.ipynb to generate the results for parts 5(b). Please run logisticRegression.ipynb to generate results for 5(b).

To generate the results for 6(a) and 6(c), please run PAQ6-Parta_c.ipynb to generate the results for Softmax regression

Similarly, run the file PAQ6-partb.ipynb to generate the results for Part 6(b).
