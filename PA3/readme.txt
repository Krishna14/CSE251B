1. Baseline
In order to run the baseline, just execute starter.py after entering into the baseline directory:

cd 3 baseline 
python starter.py

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, etc. can be tuned if needed in starter.py 
The resulting loss plot, segmentation overlayed on first test image and the classwise iou of validation set (in csv format) will get generated and saved in the same directory. 

2. Data Augmentation
To run this experiment, go inside the corresponding directory and execute starter.py

cd 4a augmentation
python starter.py

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, etc. can be tuned if needed in starter.py 
The resulting loss plot, segmentation overlayed on first test image and the classwise iou of validation set (in csv format) will get generated and saved in the same directory.
